# Active-Directory-Lab

## Objective
The Active Directory Lab project focused on building a secure environment for managing network resources. The initial phase involved deploying and configuring essential Active Directory components, including domain controllers, and implementing user and group management. Next, a simulated brute force attack was executed from an attacker machine to analyze the telemetry in Splunk. The final phase involved installing Atomic Red Team and conducting tests to detect similar attacks, enhancing the labâ€™s capability to identify and respond to threats.
